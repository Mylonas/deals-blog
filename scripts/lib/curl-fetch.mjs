/**
 * curl-fetch.mjs
 * Fetches a URL by shelling out to curl instead of using Node's built-in fetch.
 *
 * Why: on zyprus.com and bazaraki.com, Node's `fetch()` gets a 403 Cloudflare
 * challenge where curl — same URL, same headers — gets a 200. Something below
 * the HTTP layer differs; sending identical headers from `fetch()` does not
 * help. This replaced a stealth-patched headless browser that Cloudflare had
 * also started flagging, and saves ~40s of Chromium startup per source.
 *
 * This only holds from a residential IP. From a datacenter IP (GitHub Actions
 * runners included) *every* client gets challenged, curl included. curl is not
 * a way around a reputation block, only around whatever undici is doing
 * differently. That is why the cars scrape is a local command rather than a
 * nightly workflow — see README.
 *
 * Kept in sync by hand with the copy in the cyprus-house-listings repo.
